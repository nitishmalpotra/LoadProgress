**Document:** PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md
**Created:** January 30, 2025
**Source:** LoadProgress iOS Application Codebase
**Method:** Reverse Engineering from Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) was **reverse-engineered entirely from the LoadProgress iOS application source code**. Every feature, flow, business rule, and constraint documented in the PRD is derived from actual implementation, not assumptions or speculation.

**Key Statistics:**
- **44 Swift files** analyzed across main target
- **12 sections** in comprehensive PRD
- **20 use cases** documented from code flows
- **20 business rules** extracted from validation logic
- **20 non-functional requirements** identified
- **10 constraints** and **10 limitations** documented
- **10 future considerations** noted from roadmap/TODOs

---

## Derivation Methodology

### Phase 1: Architecture Discovery

**Files Analyzed:**
- `LoadProgressApp.swift` - App entry point
- `ContentView.swift` - Root view with tab navigation
- All Manager classes (DataManager, PRManager)
- All Model structs (Exercise, WorkoutSet, PersonalRecord, etc.)

**Key Findings:**
1. **MVVM Architecture** - Clear separation of Views, ViewModels (Managers), and Models
2. **SwiftUI-Based** - Modern declarative UI framework
3. **Offline-First** - No network dependencies observed
4. **Tab Navigation** - 5 main sections identified
5. **Environment Objects** - Dependency injection pattern for managers

**Evidence:**
```swift
// From LoadProgressApp.swift
@StateObject private var dataManager = DataManager()
// ...
ContentView()
    .environmentObject(dataManager)
```

---

### Phase 2: Feature Extraction

**Approach:**
1. Read all View files to understand user-facing capabilities
2. Analyze Manager classes for business logic

### Phase 3: User Flow Reconstruction

**Method:** Traced code execution paths from user actions

**Example: Workout Logging Flow**

```
User Action: Tap "Add Workout"
    ↓
Code: WorkoutLogView.swift:35-37
showingAddWorkout = true
    ↓
Code: .sheet(isPresented: $showingAddWorkout)
    ↓
View: AddWorkoutView presented
    ↓
Code: Three-tier pickers (lines 50-130)
1. Exercise Type
2. Muscle Group
3. Specific Exercise
    ↓
Code: Text fields for weight/reps (lines 132-156)
    ↓
Code: Validation (lines 204-218)
    ↓
Code: saveWorkout() method (lines 161-183)
    ↓
Code: DataManager.addWorkoutSet()
    ↓
Code: PRManager.checkForPRs() (background)
    ↓
Result: Set saved, PR detected if applicable
```

**Flows Documented:**
- App Launch (splash → main UI)
- Log Workout Set (7 steps)
- View Progress (5 steps)
- Browse Exercises (4 steps)
- Add Custom Exercise (9 steps)
- View Personal Records (4 steps)
- Volume Analytics (4 steps)
- Rest Timer Usage (3 steps)

---

### Phase 4: Business Rules Extraction

**Method:** Analyzed validation logic, calculations, and constraints

**Example: Workout Set Validation**

**Source:** `Models/WorkoutSet.swift` lines 40-79

```swift
// Rule 1: Weight > 0
guard weight > 0 else {
    throw AppError.invalidInput("Weight must be greater than 0")
}

// Rule 2: Reps > 0
guard let reps = reps, reps > 0 else {
    throw AppError.invalidInput("Reps must be greater than 0")
}

// Rule 3: RPE 1-10
guard (1...10).contains(rpe) else {
    throw AppError.invalidInput("RPE must be between 1 and 10")
}

// Rule 4: Rest time >= 0
guard restTime >= 0 else {
    throw AppError.invalidInput("Rest time must be non-negative")
}
```

**Rules Documented:**
- 20 validation rules (inputs, constraints, thresholds)
- 5 calculation formulas (1RM, volume, etc.)
- 7 UI/UX rules (limits, defaults, behaviors)
- 4 data management rules (caching, cleanup, persistence)

---

### Phase 5: Technical Stack Documentation

**Method:** Identified technologies from imports and usage

**Evidence:**

```swift
// SwiftUI
import SwiftUI

// Swift Charts
import Charts

// UIKit (haptics only)
import UIKit

// Foundation (persistence, JSON)
import Foundation

// Unified Logging
import os.log
```

**Findings:**
- **Language:** Swift 5.0+ (project settings)
- **Minimum iOS:** 18.0 (project target)
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (all views)
- **Charts:** Swift Charts (native, iOS 16+)
- **Persistence:** UserDefaults + JSON
- **Threading:** GCD (DispatchQueue)
- **Dependencies:** Zero external packages

---

### Phase 6: Data Model Documentation

**Method:** Analyzed struct definitions and properties

**Example: Exercise Model**

**Source:** `Models/Exercise.swift`

```swift
struct Exercise: Codable, Identifiable, Hashable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let type: ExerciseType
    let muscleGroup: MuscleGroup
    let secondaryMuscleGroups: [MuscleGroup]
    let icon: ExerciseIcon
    let difficulty: Difficulty
    let equipment: [Equipment]
    let description: String
    let formCues: [String]
}
```

**Nested Enumerations:**
- `ExerciseType` (2 cases)
- `MuscleGroup` (12 cases)
- `Difficulty` (4 cases)
- `Equipment` (12 cases)

**Models Documented:**
1. Exercise (10 properties, 4 nested enums)
2. WorkoutSet (9 properties, validation logic)
3. PersonalRecord (6 properties, 4 types)
4. VolumeMetrics (6 properties, calculation logic)
5. ExerciseIcon (50+ cases + custom)

---

### Phase 7: Constraint & Limitation Identification

**Method:** Found limitations from:
- TODO comments
- Empty implementations
- Missing features vs roadmap
- UserDefaults size limits
- Formula constraints (1RM)

**Examples:**

**Technical Constraint:**
```swift
// From PRManager.swift:60-61
func calculateOneRepMax(weight: Double, reps: Int) -> Double {
    guard reps > 0 && reps < 37 else { return weight }
    // Formula only valid for reps < 37
}
```

**Design Limitation:**
```swift
// From ExerciseDetailView.swift:62
ForEach(exerciseSets.prefix(10)) { set in
    // Only shows 10 most recent sets
}
```

**Missing Feature:**
```swift
// From SettingsManager.swift:13-17
@Published private(set) var autoBackupEnabled: Bool
// Toggle exists but backup not implemented
```

**Constraints Documented:**
- 5 technical constraints (iOS version, UserDefaults, formulas)
- 3 design constraints (fixed tabs, no accounts, units)
- 10 functional limitations (no editing, no export, etc.)
- 3 performance limitations (dataset size, chart points)
